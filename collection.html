    <p class="marketing-site-content-section-block-subheader subheader">The Nike Air Jordan 1 Chicago Retro from 1994 could easily be considered the most important sneaker of all time. Because Michael Jordan retired in October of 1993, after his father passed away in the summer of that year, the world was expected the iconic Air Jordans to come to an end. Thanks to the genius marketing at Nike, The Swoosh decided to pay respects to MJ and give his fans a chance to grab a pair of some of Michael Jordan’s most iconic sneakers in 1994. No sneaker grabbed the attention of basketball fans like the Air Jordan 1 did in 1985. The Chicago inspired colorway of red, black and white became the must-have for fans of MJ and quickly captured the attention of the impressionable youth of the era. So when Nike began re-releasing the Air Jordan series in 1994, it opened up a world of opportunity for retro models. Of course, the Chicago Jordan 1 is one of the most easily recognizable and most memorable thanks to Jordan’s performances, like those 63 he dropped on Boston in the 1986 playoffs. Officially the colors are simply “White/Red-Black” on the box, which is another important thing to mention about this AJ1. The 1994 Air Jordan 1 Chicago Retro is also one of the most important because of the iconic box that it came in featuring MJ moments from throughout his career. Over two decades later, these are becoming more and more rare to find in DS condition.</p>

    <h3 class="marketing-site-content-section-block-header">1994 White Cement 3</h3>
    <p class="marketing-site-content-section-block-subheader subheader">The Nike Air Jordan III Retro White/Cement first released in 1994 and was the beginning of the sneaker craze that we experience today as sneakerheads. But what led to the Jordan 3 Retro is what makes the story interesting. Michael Jordan retired in October of 1993 after his father passed away in the summer of that year. MJ’s retirement shocked the world. “I couldn’t believe my ears,” Scottie Pippen would later tell the media in response to how he took the news. With MJ leaving the NBA behind, Nike did what any company would do as their most important asset announced their retirement. They prepared to celebrate the legacy of Michael Jordan’s Nike Air Jordans by re-releasing some of the most iconic models. To many sneaker enthusiasts and basketball fans, there is no more iconic sneaker than the Air Jordan III with the Nike Air on the heel. It was the 1988 Dunk Contest, where MJ took off from the free throw line to launch himself and his Air Jordans into history. Surprisingly, the AJ3 didn’t sell as well initially as you might think because the Jordan wave had yet to really take off back in the mid-1990s compared to the retro Jordans of the modern era, so these made their way to discount racks. The Nike Air Jordan Retro 3 White Cement from 1994 also came in one of the greatest sneaker boxes ever created-- featuring photos of Michael Jordan and his Air Jordan shoes all over the box top-- further cementing Michael Jordan’s Air Jordan III as a true collector’s grail.</p>
